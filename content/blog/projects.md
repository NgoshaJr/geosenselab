The main objective of my study was to investigate the impact of rising sea levels on the distribution of mangrove species in the Sundarbans. To assess the effects of sea level rise on the distribution of mangrove species, a variety of datasets were required, including information on mangrove species and their spatial distribution, salinity, tidal statistics, and more.

To begin with, it was necessary to understand the past and present mangrove species in the study area and create a base spatial distribution map for these species. To achieve this, we utilized a remote sensing application that identified mangrove species from a recently available dense series of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. We applied machine learning techniques using supervised classification with classical algorithms to differentiate between different mangrove species. Ultimately, the random forest approach was found to provide greater precision. In collaboration with scientists from Bangladesh and Australia, we developed the methodology for preparing the spatial mangrove species map.

The results of our study showed that a projected 92-cm rise in sea level would affect approximately 15% of the distribution of Heritiera fomes, the dominant species in the Sundarbans, and about 5% of the distribution of Excoecaria agallocha. However, the species Ceriops decandra and Sonneratia apelatala have a higher salinity tolerance and are less affected. In the future, river salinization in the eastern part of the Sundarbans is expected to significantly reduce the population of the highly-valued timber species Heritiera fomes, and the species composition is likely to shift towards higher salinity-tolerant mangrove species such as Ceriops decandra and Sonneratia apelatala.

To validate the mangrove species map, we collected various global and local mangrove datasets
