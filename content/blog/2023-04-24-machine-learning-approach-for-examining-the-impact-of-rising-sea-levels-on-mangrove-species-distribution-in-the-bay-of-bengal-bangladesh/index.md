The focus of the study was to investigate the potential of an artificial deep neural network to identify two seagrass species, Enhalus acoroides and Halophila ovalis. The research project aimed to develop a seagrass detection model using UAV data and explored the capabilities of artificial deep neural networks and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imagery. The UAV images have the ability to capture fine resolution with various features such as patterns, textures, and locations. These features can be efficiently extracted and detected using deep learning algorithms.

To train and validate the model, the study selected the "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) algorithm, which has proven to be one of the most versatile and well-known object detection models. The YOLOv5 algorithm was chosen due to its speed compared to previous deep learning object detection models. The model was trained using pre-trained convolutional weights, and the best weights generated during the training phase were selected for testing.

The experimental findings revealed that the YOLOv5 algorithm achieved the following metrics on seagrass detection: a mean average precision (mAP) of 37.1%, a precision of 40.2%, and a recall of 44.3%. From this study, it can be concluded that seagrass detection using UAV data and deep learning techniques is possible. The YOLOv5 algorithm demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy in detecting the Enhalus acoroides and Halophila ovalis seagrass species.
