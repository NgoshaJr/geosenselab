I have several online profiles that I use to showcase my work and connect with colleagues in my field. One of my primary professional profiles is on LinkedIn, where I regularly post updates on my projects and connect with other professionals in my industry. I also maintain a Twitter profile where I share insights, research, and updates related to my work and connect with other professionals in my field.

 Additionally, I maintain a Github profile where I publish code and collaborate with other developers. These profiles serve as important resources for my contacts to stay up to date on my work and connect with me. I am always interested in expanding my network and connecting with other professionals, so feel free to reach out to me on any of these platforms.
